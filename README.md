Building MPS from sources
-------------------------

1. Clone MPS
2. Open the project in [IntelliJ IDEA](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea) (either Community or Ultimate Edition)
3. Attach JB JDK 11 to the project
    1. Download latest JB JDK 11 for your OS from https://bintray.com/jetbrains/intellij-jbr/
    2. *Main menu -> File -> Project Structure* opens the Project Structure dialog
    3. Under *Platform Settings -> SDK*, add a new JDK named "JB JDK 11"
4. Rebuild the project from the _Build_ menu (it will take quite a while the first time)
5. Run the _MPSLauncher_ run configuration in the _Run_ menu
6. Once MPS starts, open the _MPS_ project (point MPS to the root folder of what you've cloned)

Download
--------

If you'd prefer a ready-to-use build, please head over to the [Download](http://www.jetbrains.com/mps/download/) page and grab an installation package of your choice.

System requirements
-------------------

To build JetBrains MPS from sources you need JDK 8. Older JDK versions are currently not supported for building MPS from sources.

IntelliJ IDEA Community or Ultimate edition shall be used to open the project. The versions of IntelliJ IDEA must reflect the version (branch) of the MPS project that you are opening:
* IDEA 2018.2.* for MPS 2018.2 and the 182.* branches
* The latest Idea EAP for the MPS master branch

For *MacOS* users it is required to use the JetBrains JDK (https://bintray.com/jetbrains/intellij-jdk/).

Additionally, the *IntelliJ Platform Plugin SDK* must be added in the IntelliJ IDEA's "Project Settings" in the "Platform Settings" section. The name of this SDK must be "IDEA IC".
The *ideaIntegrationCommon* and *IDEAPlugin* modules need this SDK and they will be using automatically as soon as you create it and give it the "IDEA IC" name.
For more details on how to add an SDK in IntelliJ IDEA, consult this [help page](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/configuring-intellij-platform-plugin-sdk.html).
