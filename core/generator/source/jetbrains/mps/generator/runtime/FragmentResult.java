/**
 * Represents an outcome of template fragment.
 * We use this to hide difference between TF that produce single node and collection of nodes.
 * Besides, we keep TF parent's containment link needed for weave scenario (during weave, there's
 * supplied parent node, and knowledge about specific aggregations comes from TF's parent node,
 * while during regular apply, all TFs in template are assumed (there's checking rule to ensure that)
 * to be under same parent AND aggregation. As there's no distinction between templates for WEAVE and CALL,
 * effectively WEAVE can not inject TF nodes into different aggregation links, though it pretends it does.
 * (well, one can ignore errors in templates and get TF with different aggregation links).
 * <p/>
 * XXX Though I like the idea of templates being functional and side-effect free supplier of new nodes,
 *     I find possibility to have single template with fragments for different aggregation roles appealing.
 *     Besides, I'd like uniformity for WEAVE and CALL templates, and though different aggregations for weave
 *     don't work now (due to checking rule), there's code already that supports scenario of different
 *     aggregation roles and it's a pity to throw it away.
 *     HOWEVER, shall not forget about 'in-line' templates where no aggregation link is available.
 *   Therefore, I plan to use this FragmentResult to experiment with alternatives for TemplateDeclaration#apply.
 *   First, FragmentResult would help to streamline implementation of apply and weave, I'd like to keep
 *   differences between the two minimal. After all, there's
 *   Perhaps, in the future, a composite object with FragmentResult may replace #apply() return value (now
 *   {@code Collection<SNode>}) and there'd be no need for explicit
 *   {@link TemplateDeclarationWeavingAware2#weave(WeaveContext, NodeWeaveFacility)}, return value of apply would give
 *   a chance for outer code to control whether to apply or to weave TF outcome nodes.
 * <p/>
 * XXX If there's ever a handy way to generate sequence of optional calls a.first().second().third(),
 *     might be reasonable to return this from methods to get nice nodeFragment(tnode1).label("").reportTo() lines
 *     without intermediate local variables.
 *
 * Check {@link TemplateDeclarationWeavingAware2} for extra stuff.
