/**
 * MPS 2020.1 generates a method with a signature matching TDWA2.weave(NodeWeaveFacility), which is no longer invoked in MPS 2020.2
 * (TD.apply() with proper sink is in use, instead), therefore, this class could be deleted only once 2020.2 is out and no code referencing this class is there
 *
 * Utility to perform weaving of a node.
 * Knows parent and anchor for nodes being weaved (either one by one or by means of another {@link #weaveTemplate(TemplateDeclaration) template}
 *
 * It's pretty much just an excerpt from {@link TemplateExecutionEnvironment} tailored as an intermediate between
 * generated/interpreted weave code and generated/interpreted template. Generally, TEE is intended for use from
 * generated code, interpreted generators generally don't need additional level of indirection TEE brings. OTOH,
 * sometimes it's handy to use same code in both scenarios.
