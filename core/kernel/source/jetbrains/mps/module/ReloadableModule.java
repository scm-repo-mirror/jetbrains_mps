/**
 * BEWARE this interface will cease to extend {@code SModule}, don't cast your {@code SModule} instances to this one!
 * <p>
 * Represents a module which can be associated with some class loader, it is a unit in the MPS class loading subsystem.
 * The naming is poor: the better choice would be "DeployedModule".
 * Only some of ReloadableModule can be really reloaded at runtime.
 * (to be precise the modules which have CustomClassLoadingFacet could not be reloaded)
 * <p>
 * For example suppose there is a language module L in MPS.
 * Also let there be a solution S which uses the language L. Imagine that at some point you decide to
 * change the language L, e.g. change the editor representation for some concept C in the language L.
 * Obviously you expect MPS to change the UI appearance for the instances of the concept C in the solution S.
 * Moreover you want MPS to change the UI representation right after the used language L is generated and compiled.
 * <p>
 * To enable such workflow MPS introduces its own class loading subsystem.
 * Also it brings in a notion of reloadable modules such modules which can be redeployed during design-time in MPS (the idea plugin modules are the exception)
 * So the language L in the given example is clearly a reloadable module.
 * <p>
 * As for 191 the common workflow must look like this:
 * <code>
 * <pre>
 * default void invokeMethodFoo(@NotNull ReloadableModule module) {
 * DeploymentStatus status = module.getStatus();
 *   if (!status.canBeDeployed()) {
 *     <show a UI notification or a message in the log which says that the module can not be deployed using status.getMessage()>
 *     return;
 *   }
 *   try {
 *     Class<?> main = module.getClass("Main");
 *     Object instance = main.newInstance();
 *     <working with new instance>
 *   } catch (ClassNotFoundException e) {
 *     <show a UI notification or a message in the log which says that the class is not found>
 *   } catch (IllegalAccessException e) {
 *     e.printStackTrace();
 *   } catch (InstantiationException e) {
 *     e.printStackTrace();
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * </code>
 *
 * @apiNote The only legitimate association of {@code ReloadableModule} with {@code SModule} is to get latter by {@link #getModule()}<br/>
 *          To go from {@code SModule} to {@code ReloadableModule}, one shall use {@code ClassLoaderManager}, although generally client
 *          code shall be a subscriber to CLM events to get {@code ReloadableModule} instances there, rather than trying to discover one
 *          from {@code SModule}.<br/>
 * @see ClassLoaderManager ClassLoaderManager -- the central place for class managing in the MPS, however that class should not be accessed by anyone anymore.
 * @author apyshkin
 * @deprecated this interface is not bad per se, just the fact it extends {@code SModule} is unfortunate.
 *             Eventually, {@code ClassLoaderManager} shall use this one (and aggregate SModule)
 *             for its CL purposes, keeping SModule hierarchy (Solution, Language, Generator, etc) independent.
