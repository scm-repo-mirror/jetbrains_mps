/**
 * Thread-safe, but not-reentrant action execution mechanism, with notification dispatch on first and last action.
 * Maintains inner state to tell different execution phases like event notification and actual action execution.
 * Not reentrant means one shall not get into {@code dispatch()} when the same thread is {@link #isInsideNotificationDispatch()}
 * <br/>
 * Use {@link #dispatch(Runnable)} to execute {@link Runnable action} with proper event dispatching.
 * If you need to postpone execution (and event dispatching), you can get appropriate runnable with {@link #wrap(Runnable)}.
 * <br/>
 * {@code onActionStart} is notified prior to first action of a first thread that asked for {@code dispatch} and
 * {@code onActionFinish} is notified after the last {@code dispatch} is over.
 * <br/>
 * Actions executed from threads other than the one dispatching pre/post notifications wait for notifications to complete
 * and then make their decision whether there's a need for new round of notifications. In other words, two actions started from
 * two different thread may result in single pair of {@code onActionStart}/{@code onActionFinish} or in two independent pairs of
 * notifications. Besides, in first case there's no guarantee it would be the same thread to dispatch {@code onActionFinish} as the one
 * that fired {@code onActionStart}.
