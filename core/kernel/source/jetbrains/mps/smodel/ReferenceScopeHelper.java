   * A context to share evaluation of scope. Default implementation is as good enough for most cases, unless you intend
   * to speed up reference resolution by re-using some intermediate scope instances. E.g. each reference to an
   * {@code AbstractConceptDeclaration} calculates structure models visible/imported for a given model. When there's more than
   * one reference to {@code AbstractConceptDeclaration} within the same model (which is usually the case), model scope get
   * evaluated again and again ({@code GlobalModuleDependenciesManager} walks same module dependencies over and over).
   * Although it's not such a big deal (0.5-20 ms per call for me), with thousands of calls in a big root that might present
   * a noticeable slowdown. <br/>
   * Indeed, to make use of scope evaluation context, scope provider has to use dedicated constructs of lang.constraints,
   * MPS itself has no idea what scopes and in what context may get cached.
   * <p>
   * Default context implementation is transparent and doesn't cache anything.
