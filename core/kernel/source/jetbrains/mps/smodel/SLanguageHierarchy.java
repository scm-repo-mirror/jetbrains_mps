/**
 * Build a closure of extended or extending languages for a given set of language.
 * Likely, shall be part of openapi/smodel, but as long as it needs LanguageRegistry to access runtimes, lives in kernel.
 * XXX Though might be reasonable to introduce interface for LanguageRegistry and LanguageRuntime?
 * IMPORTANT: This class is intended for code that cares about actual runtime state. Generally, a language module may declare a dependency
 * which is not satisfied and therefore runtime counterpart for the module will miss this dependency. This is unlikely to happen now as classloading
 * is quite strict about module dependencies, and we still use source module (with all the source-level dependencies), so that Lang1 that aggregates Lang2
 * would require Lang2 to be present at classloading time and therefore RT information would be complete. Nevertheless, it's wise to keep the possible
 * distinction between declared and runtime dependencies in mind.
