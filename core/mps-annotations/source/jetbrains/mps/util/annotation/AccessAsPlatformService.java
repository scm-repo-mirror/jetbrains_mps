/**
 * A transitional mechanism to tell certain component implementations are to be retrieved as platform (IDEA) Service, not Component.
 * Generally, one could use {@code [mps].Project.getComponent(Class)} to obtain an instance. Now its implementation goes to
 * {@code [platform].Project.getComponent()} as there's no way to tell ProjectComponent API from project Service API.
 * <p>
 * Necessary for very rare scenarios where component API/interface is in pure MPS code, instance access in pure MPS code as well, but
 * registration happens in platform-specific code. Besides, doesn't make much sense for application Component/Service as these are
 * easy to replace with {@code CoreComponent}, therefore shall be employed for project services only.
 * </p>
 * <p>Once there are no more legacy components, [mps]Project.getComponent() could stick</p>
