   * TRANSITION CODE TO ADDRESS MACRO RESOLUTION ISSUES IN PATHS
   * I can't replace all uses of path-like values at once, need to keep {@code put("pathKey")/get("pathKey")} to work as it used to be.
   * Code that is capable of macro processing shall use {@code putPathSpec("pathKey")/getPathSpec("pathKey")} instead.
   * For now, I decided to stick to String value, perhaps, adding PathSpec would complicate Memento interface too much (likely, need ~PathSpec
   * in ModuleDescriptor client).
   * Ultimate goal is to:
   * (a) allow configuring ModuleDescriptor with values like "${module}/classes_gen", not actual module dir path
   * (b) get rid of MementoWithFS and streamline IFile/FS handling
   * (c) make sure we record proper macro in case few of them resolve to the same location, when
   *    {@code shrink("$mps_home/lib") == shrink("$platform_lib"} while these macros not necessarily always point to the same
   *    location (Big MPS vs MPS-as-IDEA-plugin)
