/**
 * This class represents a ModelAccess for cases when there is an available project in scope.
 * Currently it delegates all command execution to the class {@link jetbrains.mps.smodel.ModelAccess}
 *
 * FIXME Instead, shall implement executeCommand methods in this class and delegate here from respective smodel.ModelAccess methods
 *       Can use project.getRepo().getModelAccess to get here. What's tough, though, is that there is need for IDE-aware (aka workbench)
 *       model access implementation (the one that knows about undo manager and other IDEA stuff)
