/**
 * Foreign (string-based) snode id for java method stubs.
 * It is a temporary class to provide a smooth migration from the with-return-type (with-ret) java stub method ids to
 * no-return-type java stub method ids (no-ret).
 *
 * It is going to be finally dropped in 193.
 *
 * PLAN:
 * State 0 (191.eap6).
 * stub models have foreign id (persisted to :~println():void).
 * refs only have foreign ret ids
 *
 * Change 1: in a stub java class we started creating a StringBasedIdJavaStubMethods id (which we will call foreign* id below).
 * #toString method returned the same string only with another prefix (:~println:void -> :#println:void).
 * we wrote a migration resaving the node ids in the java stub method references to the new ones (beginning with the new symbol '#').
 *
 * State 1 (191.eap7).
 * stub models have foreign* id (persisted to :#println():void).
 * ref a has foreign with-ret id; (before the migration)
 * ref b has foreign* id;
 * all resolve fine:
 * foreign*#hash is based on with-ret part
 * foreign* :eq: foreign* if with-ret ids are the same
 * foreign* :eq: foreign if foreign* with-ret and foreign ids are the same
 *
 * after the migration no java method stub references are foreign, all of them are persisted as foreign*!
 *
 * The PROBLEM was that the change was breaking (suddenly MPS.183 could not read the models containing new refs with '#').
 * So at that point we changed the plan and gave up the idea of mediating persistence with the symbol '#'.
 *
 * Change 2: we changed the foreign* id in such a way that it persists to the foreign id without return type.
 * Thus instead of (:#println:void) the toString method returns (:~println).
 * By the way the foreign* id did not change the #equals and #hashcode methods, only the method #toString.
 *
 * Furthermore, we created a special {@link jetbrains.mps.smodel.nodeidmap.MigratingJavaStubRefsNodeIdMap} in the JavaClassStubModelDescriptor
 * which essentially for each stub java method node creates two different mappings: for a string id with return type and for a string id without return type.
 *
 * State 2: (191.eap8).
 * stub models have foreign* id (persisted to :~println()).
 *
 * ref a has a foreign with-ret id, ver<=191.eap8;
 * ref b has a foreign without-ret id, ver>=191.eap8; (after the migration)
 * ref c has a foreign* with-ret id, ver=191.eap7;
 * ref d has a foreign* with-ret id, ver>=191.eap8;
 * all resolve fine, see the {@link jetbrains.mps.smodel.nodeidmap.MigratingJavaStubRefsNodeIdMap} javadoc.
 *
 * The next problem was that find usages stopped working since the node access is not done via the model but via the node id directly.
 * The problem evolves only after we migrate all the java stub method references.
 * It appeared that the second approach (hacking the INodeToNodeMap) fails for some API clients, who do not access SNode by requesting it
 * from SModel#getNode(SNodeId).
 *
 * Consider the contract below.
 * <code>
 *   SModel someModel; // some stub model which contains a node with the following id
 *   SNodeIdWithReturn anId = createFromString("~PrintStream:println(String):void");
 *   Assert.assertTrue(anId.equals(someModel.getNode(anId).getNodeId()));
 * </code>
 * The problem was that it starts failing after we run the migration (191.eap8).
 * It fails just because the method node in the java stub model possesses with-ret id, and after the migration all the references
 * consists of no-ret ids.
 * Before the migration the contract holds.
 * The following change was performed in order to make it vice versa: the contract is broken before we run the migration and holds
 * after.
 *
 * Change 3: we changed the foreign* id #getId, #hashcode and #equals methods in such a way that the foreign* id instance
 * is associated solely with no-ret string.
 * The map {@link jetbrains.mps.smodel.nodeidmap.MigratingJavaStubRefsNodeIdMap} in the JavaClassStubModelDescriptor did not change its contents.
 *
 * State 3: (191.1). [WE ARE HERE]
 * stub models have foreign* id (persisted to :~println()).
 *
 * Again,
 * ref a has a foreign with-ret id, ver<=191.eap8;
 * ref b has a foreign without-ret id, ver>=191.eap8; (after the migration)
 * ref c has a foreign* with-ret id, ver=191.eap7;
 * ref d has a foreign* with-ret id, ver>=191.eap8;
 * all resolve fine, see the {@link jetbrains.mps.smodel.nodeidmap.MigratingJavaStubRefsNodeIdMap} javadoc.
 * If accessed via SModel, with-ret and without-ret ids resolve fine because of the hack in the node id map;
 * otherwise _before the migration_ with-ret node ids are not present in the model, so some places will fail to find the nodes by the with-ret id
 * (like find usages with index which tracks back the references to the java stub methods), however _after the migration_ such places must work as
 * expected.
 *
 * BACKWARD PERSISTENCE COMPATIBILITY:
 * State 0 (191.eap6 build or earlier):
 * stub models have foreign id (persisted to :~println():void).
 *
 * ref a has a foreign with-ret id, ver<=191.eap8 resolves fine;
 * ref b has a foreign without-ret id, ver>=191.eap8 does not resolve;
 * ref c has a foreign* with-ret id, ver=191.eap7 does not resolve AND THROW ModelReadException, THE MODEL COULD NOT BE PARSED (sic!);
 * ref d has a foreign* with-ret id, ver>=191.eap8 resolves fine (since foreign* after 191.eap8 is persisted with '~').
 *
 * State 1 (191.eap7 build):
 * stub models have foreign* id (persisted to :#println():void).
 *
 * ref a has a foreign with-ret id, ver<=191.eap8 resolves fine;
 * ref b has a foreign without-ret id, ver>=191.eap8 does not resolve;
 * ref c has a foreign* with-ret id, ver=191.eap7 resolves fine;
 * ref d has a foreign* with-ret id, ver>=191.eap8 resolves fine (since foreign* after 191.eap8 is persisted with '~').
 *
 * Summary:
 * We have a break in a compatibility for those clients who try to open (or merge or anything) the MPS models ver=191.eap7
 * using the MPS ver<=191.eap6.
 *
 * FUTURE:
 * (2xx release) Change 4: removing this class and the migrating map, all java stub method are resolved by no-return-signatures now.
