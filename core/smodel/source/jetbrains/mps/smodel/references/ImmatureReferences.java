// Given the fact it's MA with its command start/finish events to turn this ImmatureReferences collector on/off,
// and there's only 1 command thread, we resort to thread-local non-synchronized collection of references that need to be
// processed once command is over. Besides, as we invoke instance methods on these references, we can use 'identity' to match them (no need to bother with
// hashCode/equals).
// With present approach, nodes created in threads other than command one won't get their references recorded here. Though it's slightly different from the
// earlier approach (where any thread producing a node b/w enable/disable got it recorded), it's still valid, as there never was a guarantee than the parallel
// thread producing nodes would get exactly b/w enable/disable calls. If, however, there's explicit synchronization b/w threads to accomplish that, I'd better
// figure it out. This mechanism is internal implementation detail, and there should be no code to rely/utilize it
//
// This is not a CoreComponent, rather an implementation friend of MA class. Since we don not control StaticReference instantiation, we resort to this
// singleton class to record model reference come and go.
