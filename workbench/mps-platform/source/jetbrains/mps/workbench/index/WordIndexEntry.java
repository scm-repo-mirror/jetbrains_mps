 * Pretty much the same as IdIndexEntry from IDEA, key to represent a search word.
 * At the moment, represents a hash of a single word (case-insensitive), in future, perhaps, we move to use n-grams instead.
 * There's little value in using this class over java.lang.Integer, it just makes the code easier to read.
