/**
 * On the key press (alt+shift+down/up) event IDEA tries to identify the tool window which contains the OccurrenceNavigator
 * in order to invoke goToNext/Prev action on it.
 * However it does not account for the scenario when the selection (or focus, whatever) is located in another tool window.
 * Since MPS allows it for the inspector tool, we need to deal with that case on our own.
